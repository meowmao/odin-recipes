        These homemade cream puffs are made with a light choux pastry that puffs up when baked. In this version, they are filled with a rich vanilla cream that's easy to make with instant pudding. Drizzle melted chocolate on top for a fancy dessert that will wow your guests!

            <li>2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and refrigerate to set. </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil. </li>
            <li>Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. </li>
            <li>Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a couple of inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Centers should be dry.</li>
            <li>When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! </li>
